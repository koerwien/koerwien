Hello! I am a mathematician who graduated in mathematical logic and did 7 years of postdoc research in the field. 

For several years now I am concentrating on software development, mainly mobile and web, private projects and freelancing.

My main interests are all that combines mathematics and programming, for example security/cryptography, AI/machine learning. I also have a fascination with exploring and understanding what are good programming practices and why, and with the rapid evolution of new frameworks like is the case in web development.
